 I am a big fan of video games and I prefer indie games most. My most favorite game is <i>Celeste</i>. Reaching to the summit is this game's ultimate goal. I really enjoy the journey while climbing and the process of overcoming obstacles.

Creating such a world will always be a goal in my life span.
