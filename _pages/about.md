Currently I am a third-year master student in the Center of Data Science, AAIS, Peking University, supervised by Prof.  [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). I am also a research intern of Visual Computing Group in Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by Dr. [Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/) and working closely with [Yue Cao](http://yue-cao.me/), [Zheng Zhang](https://stupidzz.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Xiamen University.
